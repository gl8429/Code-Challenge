Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Hint:

An easy approach is to sort the array first.
What are the possible values of h-index?
A faster approach is to use extra space.

// 这个题目 首先可以发现 h-index 是不会大于总文章数的

// Bucket sort 思路
public class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int len = citations.length;
        int[] count = new int[len + 1];
    
        for (int c: citations)
            if (c > len) 
                count[len]++;
            else 
                count[c]++;
    
    
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = len; i >= 0; i--) {
            total += count[i];
            if (total >= i)
                return i;
        }
    
        return 0;
    }
}

// Sort first
public class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        int len = citations.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < citations.length; i++) {
            if (len <= citations[i]) return len;
            else len--;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
