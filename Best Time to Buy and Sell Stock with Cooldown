/**

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)
Example:

prices = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]
maxProfit = 3
transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]

/**

For each of them we make an array, buy[n], sell[n] and rest[n].

buy[i] means before day i what is the maxProfit for any sequence end with buy.

sell[i] means before day i what is the maxProfit for any sequence end with sell.

rest[i] means before day i what is the maxProfit for any sequence end with rest.

Then we want to deduce the transition functions for buy sell and rest. By definition we have:

buy[i]  = max(rest[i-1]-price, buy[i-1]) 
sell[i] = max(buy[i-1]+price, sell[i-1])
rest[i] = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1], rest[i-1])
Where price is the price of day i. All of these are very straightforward. They simply represents :

(1) We have to `rest` before we `buy` and 
(2) we have to `buy` before we `sell`

Well, the answer lies within the fact that buy[i] <= rest[i] which means rest[i] = max(sell[i-1], rest[i-1]). That made sure [buy, rest, buy] is never occurred.

A further observation is that and rest[i] <= sell[i] is also true therefore

rest[i] = sell[i-1]
Substitute this in to buy[i] we now have 2 functions instead of 3:

buy[i] = max(sell[i-2]-price, buy[i-1])
sell[i] = max(buy[i-1]+price, sell[i-1])
Since states of day i relies only on i-1 and i-2 we can reduce the O(n) space to O(1). And here we are at our final solution:
