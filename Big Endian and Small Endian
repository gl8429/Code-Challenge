Suppose we are on a 32-bit machine.

If it is little endian, the x in the memory will be something like:

       higher memory
          ----->
    +----+----+----+----+
    |0x01|0x00|0x00|0x00|
    +----+----+----+----+
    A
    |
   &x
so (char*)(*x) == 1, and *y+48 == '1'.

If it is big endian, it will be:

    +----+----+----+----+
    |0x00|0x00|0x00|0x01|
    +----+----+----+----+
    A
    |
   &x
so this one will be '0'.
